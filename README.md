# Data-Analytics-Portfolio-

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository showcases my projects demonstrating skills in Excel and SQL for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Projects

### 1. [Excel Project](Excel-Project/)
- **Objective:** Analyze and visualize [bike sales data].
- **Highlights:**
  - Data cleaning and transformation using Excel functions.
  - Created dashboards and charts to present insights.
  - Key findings include [Income and Bike Purchase Correlation:

Higher income levels are associated with a greater likelihood of purchasing a bike.
Males consistently have higher average incomes than females, particularly among those who purchased bikes.
Gender Trends:

Males show a stronger correlation between income and bike purchases compared to females.
Targeting higher-income male demographics may be a strategic approach for sales.
Age Distribution:

The dataset categorizes individuals into "adult" and "old." Purchase behavior might vary significantly by age, with adults likely being a more prominent buyer segment.
Regional Insights:

Regional differences, such as in Europe and the Pacific, might influence bike purchasing trends.
These insights can guide location-specific marketing strategies.
Commute Distance and Lifestyle Factors:

Individuals with shorter commute distances ("0-1 Miles") may be more inclined to purchase bikes, as cycling might align with their commuting habits.
Education and Occupation:

Higher education levels (e.g., Bachelors) and professional occupations seem positively correlated with bike purchases.].

### 2. [SQL Data Cleaning and EDA Project](SQL-EDA-Project/)
- **Objective:** Clean messy data and uncover trends using SQL.
- **Highlights:**
  - Cleaned raw data using SQL queries (e.g., handling duplicates, null values).
  - Performed exploratory analysis to identify trends and patterns.
  - Key insights include [brief summary].
