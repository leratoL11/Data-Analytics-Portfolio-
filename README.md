# Data-Analytics-Portfolio-

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository showcases my projects demonstrating skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Projects

### 1. **Excel Data Analysis & Visualization - Bike Sales Data**
- **Overview**: This project involves analyzing and visualizing bike sales data to uncover trends, sales patterns, and insights into customer behavior.
- **Tools**: Microsoft Excel
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on bike sales data.
  - Created pivot tables to analyze sales by region, bike model, and time period.
  - Built visualizations (charts/graphs) to present sales performance, trends, and comparisons.
  - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics (e.g., high sales, low sales).
  - Analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) to help the business make data-driven decisions.

#### Files Included:
- `https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx`: The raw dataset.

### 2. **SQL Data Cleaning & Transformation - Company Layoffs Data**
- **Overview**: This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset about company layoffs using SQL. The goal was to standardize the data and generate meaningful insights.
- **Tools**: SQL
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Cleaned the raw layoffs data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
  - Used SQL queries for data transformation (e.g., filtering, grouping, aggregating) to prepare the data for analysis.
  - Created derived columns such as year of layoffs, total layoffs per company, and industry-specific trends.
  - Provided insights into trends such as the frequency of layoffs, affected sectors, and key company-level metrics.

#### Files Included:
- `https://github.com/leratoL11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.sql`: SQL scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
- `https://github.com/leratoL11/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql`: SQL queries used to extract key insights.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard - Data Professionals Survey Analysis**
- **Overview**: This Power BI project visualizes insights from a survey of data professionals, exploring areas such as job satisfaction, skills, and career progression.
- **Tools**: Power BI
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Imported survey data into Power BI and performed data cleaning using Power Query.
  - Built interactive dashboards showing key statistics such as job satisfaction, salary ranges, industry distribution, and top skills.
  - Created slicers and filters to allow users to explore the data by job title, experience level, and location.
  - Developed insights into the skills most valued by employers, career growth opportunities, and job satisfaction trends.

#### Files Included:
